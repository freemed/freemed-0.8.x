A great deal of phpgacl has been stripped out, as it is not needed by the
system. To resync with the mainstream distribution, you need:

	Cache_Lite/
	adodb/
	gacl.class.php
	gacl_api.class.php
	schema.xml

The admin interface should be leaving, as we can use most of its capabilties
ourselves.

The following files have to be re-added if this is erased (excluding the
Makefile system, of course):

	.htaccess
	CONTENTS (this file)
	freemed-acl-defaults.xml

// taken care of by an "error" index.html file
// which should never be seen if apache/php/php-mysql are all correct...

//Phase I - Database connectivity

// If that doesnt work then we either give helpful error messages or we 
// use a Wizard to set things up

// We want to interpret the errors that we get for the user. 
// that means we need to turn the normal error handling off for a littlewhile
// Note to Jeff: maybe we should have a "developer mode" where this doesnt happen...

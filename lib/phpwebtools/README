phpwebtools are meant to be a collection of useful tools and classes to
help in the construction of "enterprise" web applications. Many classic
GUI "widgets", such as the GTK "notebook" are implemented here as
extensible classes. Please note that it requires PHP 4.0 or higher,
although it may work with later versions of PHP 3.0.x (this is unconfirmed).

webtools.php		This is the main webtools file. It includes all of
			the other class files, and therefore is the only one
			that needs to be include'd.

Most other files in this distribution contain NaturalDocs (naturaldocs.org)
documentation, which more fully explains the functions and methods available.

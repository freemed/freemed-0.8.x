This is a brief HOWTO concerning language translations for FreeMED using
GettextXML. This is an XML-based format which resembles GNU gettext in
many aspects.

There is a community site for translating FreeMED, which can be
visited at http://i18n.freemedsoftware.org/ .

INITIAL TRANSLATION-------------------------------------------------------

The first thing you have to do is run the generation program, to generate
a template for you to translate. This is accomplished with a command like
the following:

	./scripts/GettextXML_Catalog.pl (lang_locale) (description)

Assign a language abbreviation:

Examples:
	en = English
	es = Espagnole
	de = Deutche
	et cetera

The locale is an uppercase 2-character country code.

Examples:
	CA = Canada
	UK = England / United Kingdom
	FR = France
	US = United States

The "description" should be something descriptive regarding the language
and country it is for (American English, etc).

The language files are in this format:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<gettextXML lang="en_US">

        <information>
                <Application>FreeMED</Application>
                <ApplicationVersion>0.6.0</ApplicationVersion>
                <Component>freemed</Component>
                <ComponentVersion></ComponentVersion>
                <Locale>en_US</Locale>
                <LocaleName>American English</LocaleName>
                <RevisionDate>2006-06-18</RevisionDate>
                <RevisionCount>1</RevisionCount>
		<Generator>GettextXML</Generator>
		<ContentTransferEncoding>8bit</ContentTransferEncoding>
		<Translator>some_guy@i18n.org</Translator>
	</information>

	<translation>
		<original>original</original>
		<translated>translated</translated>
	</translation>

</gettextXML>

You can then use either a text editor or an XML tool to edit the texts.
They are generated in locale/language_locale/ (example: locale/en_US).

Send this translation to irv@ourexchange.net or jeff@ourexchange.net so
that it is included in the distribution. Please ZIP or tarball it prior
to transmission.

REVISED TRANSLATIONS------------------------------------------------------

You need to run the autogeneration script to do this, and provide the same
locale and locale name as you did when it was initially run. For example:

	cd /usr/share/freemed
	./scripts/GettextXML_Catalog.pl en_US "American English"

This will cause all translation tables to be updated, while still keeping
the translated strings that have been done already.

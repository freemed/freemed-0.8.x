20000101 --
n Happy new century or millenium or year or whatever! Nothing crashed! Y2K
  was a bunch of hot air, and it was about the same as any other moment. Eh.
m Payment calc routines work now, and since the 0.1 release is scheduled for
  today, there'll be just enough time to clean up some *really* messy spots
  in the code and finish up the install script before the PR stuff goes out.
a Among other things, added an Internal Service Type table which Physicians/
  Providers use for pricing structure. Pretty keen if you ask me.

19991230 --
m overhauled med manager patient import script to pull ICD code references
  from the diagcode.dat file
m overhauled episode of care support in progress notes and procedures
m fixed several longstanding manage.php3 problems
m fixed up procedure.php3 to actually work with most things, including
  action=modform

19991229 --
a added scripts/convert/medical_manager directory for Perl scripts to
  convert from old Medical Manager 6.x databases.
a scripts/convert/medical_manager/diagcode.pl for ICD codes
a scripts/convert/medical_manager/patfile.pl for patient record(s)
a import.php3 to handle importing of databases from legacy apps

19991228 --
m soundex queries on patient database work now!
m iso set field added in patient and progress notes tables
a added payreclock field in payrec database for locking of dates through
  "closes"
a added cpttype for doctor's billing schedules

19991227 --
n sorry about the lack of a day of coding. I really meant to, but I've been
  trying not to go loopy in the meantime.
m working on the cpt module -- hopefully will be 100% operational today
a added scripts/install.sh as a beginning to a good install script

19991225 --
m christmas fixes -- freemed now works on fresh systems for reiniting dbs,
  since everyone has complained about this for a *long* time.
a cpt module from scratch. don't know how well it works yet, but I'm trying.
m more things -- but who cares? code matters, not lengthy changelog entries

19991224 --
m huge changes to all aspects of financial and billing thingies
a new procedure.php3 module built from the ground up
m API changes, lots of small fixes for little things. too many to list --
  check the CVS changelog record for more information

19991223 --
m fixes to episode_of_care.php3 ... now working to make this package kick
  some serious tail before the new year. Billing *will* work.

19991219 --
a added "manage" action to Episode of Care to allow centralized management
  of Episodes, with links to progress notes, etc
m modified billing_functions.php3 to be based in a table and better put
  together
a added left/right capabilities in custom_records module and moved most of
  the formatting stuff to "type formatting". now an "L" in a record should
  lock that field, and a "2" in a record should specify left and right (this
  is referring to the maxlen field...)
a tried to add soundex search capabilities to patient module, but am having
  huge problems with it.

19991217 --
n I've been really under a lot of stress, so I've been slacking off. But
  it's time to get cracking.
a modified progress notes to have links to Episode of Care multiple choice
  support
m progress notes now use Patient class
m progress notes now has links to management menu, as well as the BR/BR ->
  P conversion and a few other updates
n still have to put EOC support in progress notes' display and modform
  sections. d'oh.

19991206 --
n moderately stressful weekend, but the doc and I figured out how to do
  GEHR/H7 compliant objects and patient records. we really weren't that
  far off to begin with, but we need to start embedding the ISO set and
  possibly the language.
a added Freemed+PostgreSQL-HOWTO for all those people who think that
  MySQL isn't their "cup of pie"

19991203 --
m updated CREDITS file, finally -- with new contributors. sorry if I left
  anyone out... please let me know.
m modified simplereports choose action to be slightly nicer format and
  to use patient class container
m monkeyed around with simplereports... not sure if they work 100% right
m fixed gender identifier generation problem in simplerep

19991202 --
m modified patient class container to be able to hold call-in data with a
  tiny abstraction and a flag called is_callin ... should probably make a
  function to refer to that as well.
a added Ergin Soysal's new on demand language loader, which has also been
  moved to global.var.inc's loader section from freemed-functions.inc

19991201 --
m implementing class containers across modules to make development easier --
  so far we only have the patient class, but I'm sure we'll come up with
  more...

19991130 --
m fixed changelog entry to read 19991129 instead of 19991124... d'oh!
m implemented new section in global.var.inc for loading of different
  handling and class "modules"
m included new class containers (containers.inc) in global.var.inc
a added new functions to class container Patient 
a added CONTAINERS API description

19991129 --
m fixed gfx enable/disable to work with the top menu bar, and squashed some
  scope bugs while I was at it. need to remember to translate the text on
  the menubar
n possibility of integration of a nicer/purtier calendar/scheduler system
  because my calendaring skills aren't very finely honed...
m fixed payment_record.php3 to have proper comma in INSERT, and added a
  link in manage.php3 to link it it
a added container.inc to have class containers for data objects, which should
  make freemed into a much more relational database-type deal for those who
  dain to code it.

19991124 --
m overhauling patient module to be in tables and look purtier, as well
  as having date and phone extentions in them...

19991123 --
m overhauled ICD9/10 database, adding meta descriptors and fixing old
  legacy problems with module -- hopefully we can get this at 100%
  capacity very soon.
m modified admin.php3 table for icd codes

19991122 --
n finially got back to working on the project -- after a week of working on
  something else...
a added patient_image_handler.php3 and defs to admin.php3 to handle it...
  has support for patient pictures (ID photos...) and xrays, will add support
  for clinical photos as well -- perhaps adding the possibility of thumbnailing
  large photos, etc... resizing?? etc

19991116 --
m fixed up physician availability map -- will work into calendar routines
  soon.
a added phy_avail_map.php3 to the db_maintenance menu, so that it is
  accessable to users...
a date_in_range function added to freemed-calendar-functions.inc

19991115 --
a more features for custom reports
n looking into an HL7 parsing engine -- if anyone is interested, please
  contact me (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu)
m updated BROWSERS with the QNX Voyager single-disk OS/browser combo
  (http://www.qnx.com/demodisk/) which works as well
m patched custom records to be able to deal with multiple checkboxes, and
  soon multiple choice things as well.

19991113 --
a added locking features for dates in custom reports, changed length of
  limits field to allow for temps, etc, and made the headings more readable

19991112 --
a added types heading and checkbox to the custom records modules
a added a "line insert" box at the bottom of the custom records template
  module to facilitate easy addition of lines.
m fixed some perfectly dumb typos in custom_reports.php3 and even a bug
  in the CHANGELOG!
a implemented mini iconbar in freemed_display_box_top ... but haven't worked
  in the graphics enabled/disabled toggle yet

19991111 --
m fixed perfectly retarded error in custom_records.php3 -- well, alright,
  _several_ perfectly retarded errors. must not code so fast - produces
  errors.
m modified payrec structure inside admin.php3 to correspond to the date of
  payment (payrecdt) which somehow got left out -- I still have to do a
  bunch of record folding for all the fields to fit in the one descrip
  field ...
m made fm_date_entry work with all pulldowns, but needed to add a true/false
  pre_epoch parameter to allow for older dates (i.e. birthdates, injuries,
  etc)
m major work going on in payment_record.php3 -- needed for 0.1alpha

19991109 --
m started CVS repository -- many problems, but it seems to work now.
m heavily ripped apart phone function -- for some reason array_value never
  got put through as -1, so I smashed the hell out of the function to allow
  the custom records to partially work
m heavy work on custom records -- they actually seem to work now
n I'm cutting down on changelog entries because I have to enter this into CVS
  as well... just major things from now on.
m un-fscked the phone assembling function -- used != instead of == by accident

19991108 --
m fix for fm_eval where variables were not being listed with $s
m another fix for fm_eval to avoid warnings -- GLOBALS and key are not
  evaluated.
a added prtvar value in 3d array to allow variables to be passed on from
  here...

19991105 --
m major change -- moved all 3d arrays out of EOC -- db change
m lots of physician.php3 and simplerep*.php and language mods
a added (finalized as well) fm_number_select to allow ranged selectable
  numbers -- really great if you ask me.
a added oldreports database definition to admin.php3
a added phofmt to config sections in admin.php3 for phone format -- only
  two options right now, which are United States and unformatted -- more if
  people ask for them.
m fixed really dumb spelling bug in fm_date_assemble because the correct vars
  were not being brought in with the eval (global ....;)
d removed html.php3, since it was moved to simplerep_html.php3 ... funny
  how I never notice these things until Max tells me.
a functions fm_phone_entry and fm_phone_assemble are now in the API and I'll
  hopefully remember to put in their descriptions into the API documentation.
m d'oh! another bug in fm_date_assemble -- hopefully squashed now.
m finally! Episode of Care seems to work with add/mod through most cases, tho
  I haven't gotten to check it out as much as I should...

19991104 --
m from max, fixes to simplerep (with lang modules) and physician modules
m fixed stupid bracket bug (are there any other kinds?) in mail API ... what
  would I do without Max pointing these things out?
m thought about it twice, and added a routine to scan through all of the
  global variables and make them local in fm_eval (thanks to Max for pointing
  this one out)

19991103 --
m from Max, physician.php3 and EN/FR/ES language modules for it
d removed _old_ "select" action from physician.php3
m fm_date_assemble now supports array indexes, for handy array folding...
m fixed fm_date_entry to use 2 digits for month and day in the pulldown
  values, to avoid misshappen dates...
m combined the add and mod actions in episode_of_care.php3 to save space, time
  and sanity -- perhaps a reworking of the template is in order?
m fixed mention of releasedto in insert for 3d array in EOC
a added most of an INSERT command for EOC, action=add
m with only one monkey typing at one computer, I managed to get the defs into
  admin (preliminary, of course) and set up most of a squash for add/mod in
  EOC (which is what the admin definition is for)... hopefully I can finish
  the mod tomorrow, since I don't have enough time today.
m fixed horrible bug in extra 0 insert in API's fm_date_entry, by using extra
  variable (stupid kludge, I know)
m forgot Date of Confinement... (to new format...)
a began to add fm_number_select for ranged number select boxes, but didn't
  _quite_ get around to finishing, or even really starting it. tomorrow. it's
  only a day away.

19991102 --
m Max stamped out $SELECTED bug in API
m from Max, simplerep routines changes, with lout formatting changes
m jeff: modified simplerep.php3 to use METHOD=POST -- hope the change gets
  to Max
d removed the java/ parts from John Gage (we decided on an eventual port from
  Java to PHP) and a whole bunch of useless stuff in old/ ...
m fixed spelling of "Address" in lang/EN/patient.php3.EN.inc
m implemented new fm_date_entry and fm_date_assemble in patient.php3
m fixed stupid : missing in admin.php3 that broke it yesterday, as well as
  spelling OPTION as OPIION, which didn't work either.
n the date formatting functions seems to work flawlessly. now is the time to
  implement them everywhere, then work on a method of doing phone numbers
  as well.
m implemented date functions in progress_notes.php3, taking out YYYY-MM-DD
  references and moving to direct date assignment in action=addform.
a added LINKS document with some URLs of where the project has been mentioned.
a added the GPL as LICENSE
m fixed following files for dates (hopefully):
  book_appointment.php3
  manage_appointments.php3
  progress_notes.php3
  Rx.php3
  partial workings on episode_of_care.php3
m had to rewrite the fscking fm_date_entry routine to accomodate arrays ...
  just put the array index (or some number other than -1 if you don't want
  any value there) to make it put it through as an array...
n releasing now -- not ... responsible .. for ... bugs ...

19991101 --
a/m from Max:
  simplerep modules
  translations
  new simplerep_plaintext_email module
  more lout defs
m slightly updated feature set.
m modified Rx.php3 and admin.php3 to allow Rx.php3 to store MD5 sums in the
  database -- now if someone would only put in a generation routine for them,
  we'd really be cooking.
m changed config in admin.php3 to allow for date formatting
a added fm_date_entry and fm_date_assemble to allow for use of date formatting
  without any hassle -- a little more help from the ol' API.
n not quite done with fm_date_entry yet -- implementing pull downs for the
  date. had to spit-n-bailing-wire together a routine to pull out the global
  vars, compare to the whole date, etc. will finish tomorrow
m changed physical_loc var in global var inc to be chop(`pwd`) for now.

19991029 --
a added diagfamily table (diagnosis_family.php3 module) for diagnosis
  families, from template
a added entry for diagnosis family in db_maintenance.php3
m modified fm_multiple_choice to have extra optional parameter for display of
  "ALL" (-1) option
m modified fm_join_from_array to correctly work with both regular variables
  and one-element arrays, by using !is_array instead of count()
m fixed checking routine for EOC facilities 3D array
m added disabilities 3D array in EOC module
a added diagnosis family multiple choice and episode type to EOC module
a added disabilities 3D sub-table into EOC module -- maybe we're ready to
  fly with this? soon?

19991028 --
n am applying doc's corrections to Episode of Care module
m fixed freemed_display_insco function to accept no params (doc)
m moved time of death and coroner, etc, off of the facilities 3D
  section and down into the regular part, since usually people only
  die once. unless they're irish ;).
a added "fold-out" other relation specific field(s) in EOC (doc)
a added patient_record_template.php3 with 3D tables to handle custom info
  gathering -- now I just have to make the engine to handle it.
a added entry for patient_record_template in db_maintenance, with language
  stuff in lang/EN/db_maintenance, needing translations...

19991027 --
m monkeyed around with authenticate.php3 and the box_top display to actually
  pass the entire URL instead of just parts of it, by using the global var
  for URI, found at http://www.phpwizard.net/ ... gotta love it
a modified mime_mail class (GPL) for freemed, calling it mail_message, mow
  in freemed-mail-functions -- when I get the time, I'll build a mailer right
  into this...
m in EOC, fixed the syntax checking on the Authorizations 3D table -- working
  on facilities table now

19991026post --
d removed old freemed-functions.inc.old file, which was just taking up space
  after the GUI improvement. too bad I forgot to write this _before_ the
  release, even though I did it before I released.

19991026 --
n sorry about the delay in working -- the doc and I were working on the
  incident/ailment/episode-of-care stuff and I forgot my worksheet at home
  on monday -- d'oh!
a/m from Max:
  {simplerep,simplerep_lout,simplerep_html,select_printers}.php3
  data/lout/sr_{doc,sheet,defs}
  lang/EN/{simplerep,simplerep_lout}.php3.EN.inc
  lang/FR/{simplerep,simplerep_lout}.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/{simplerep,simplerep_lout}.php3.ES.inc
m temporarily added $Export_Data to lang/EN/API.EN.inc because I had
  $Export_Database there instead -- hmm.
m changed '\\' to '\\\\' in freemed_export_data function in the API, so that
  the characters are escaped properly -- was causing errors in the export.
m added $debug to the global tag of freemed_export_data so that debug info
  was actually passed.
m more changes to freemed_display_box_top to actually pass $_ref if not
  actually specified in calling
a dumped the Doc's additions to Physician Specialties and Degrees (which
  definately aren't all of them, but definately enough to get started on)
  in the data/EN/ directory for import with the stock version
a added fm_htmlize_array for passing an array as HTML hidden input tags,
  updated API listing for it as well
a added episode_of_care.php3 as the module for Incidents/Ailments/
  Episodes of Care ... to be called with a patient # ($patient) ... uses
  combined add/modify sections as in fixed_forms.php3. and implements
  3D SQL arrays, with the possibility of implementing virtual 4D SQL
  arrays (for certain multiple choice variables)
  (con't)
  still plunking away at this ... no database structure for sure yet, since
  I've added 5-10 fields while looking at my slip of paper, so I'll just get
  the add/mod routine set up, then people can let me know what we're missing
  and maybe we can get this done...
a added link for Episode of Care temporarily in Manage Patient so that I can
  go over the form with people without typing in URLs -- will also be the
  permanant link once it is translated.

19991022 --
m changed API for newer box style (freemed-functions.inc, index.php3)
a added fm_eval and fm_secure as evaluation handling routines in the API
a added the functions from freemed-calendar-functions.inc to the API listing
  file so that we aren't going about function documentation the Redmond (tm)
  way. ;)
m updated authenticate.php3 and logout.php3 to have cleaner box-based
  interfaces instead of the ol' eyesore method.
m fixed bug in book_appointment.php3 where moving forwards or backwards did
  not pass $type, and therefore did not work for call-ins
a added facilities for moving around time-wise while looking at the day
  calendar (step2) in book_appointment.php3
n verified booking routine _does_ seem to work for English in most, if not
  all, circumstances that I have seen.

19991021 --
m fixed _stupid_ mistake in fixed_forms.php3 where I forgot to carry a
  change across all iterations.
a added error checking to fixed forms, so that their numbers appear as
  red if there is an error or they are new.
a added fm_prep function for preparing strings to be shown in HTML (API)
m modified fixedform definition in admin.php3
n tried freemed with Postgres -- it crapped out and wouldn't let me set up
  anything. has anyone tried with anything other than MySQL?
m added "Fixed Forms" to the db_maintenance.php3 module -- eagerly awaiting
  translations for it and the actual fleshing out of all words to be
  translated...
n sorry about not having included the ISO codings into records yet -- I'll
  have to look into doing it soon, though, since interest in it seems to be
  picking up.
a added "Back to Menu" function from the Add/Modify pulldown in fixed_forms,
  to make it a little easier on me...

19991020 --
a/m from Max:
  {simplerep,simplerep_html,simplerep_lout,select_printers}.php3
  lang/EN/{select_printers,db_maintenance}.php3.EN.inc
  lang/FR/{select_printers,db_maintenance}.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/{select_printers,db_maintenance}.php3.ES.inc
  data/lout/sr_defs
m YEEEES! I got 3d arrays for forms to work properly, including inserting
  deleting, and all sorts of other goodies...
a added fixed_forms.php3, no language module yet.
m fixed_forms.php3 joins the add and modify forms into one, so as to eliminate
  excess coding (yes, I'm that lazy) and to consolidate changes to the form.
  I've been trying to make it a little more horizontal and less vertical...
m fixed fm_(whatever) array functions to do error checking for single element
  arrays and nulls, so that we don't have to keep doing it. updated in API

19991019 --
n going to make a go at doing multidimensional (3d) arrays for forms -- uugh!

19991018 --
m tracked down stupid facility=ALL bug in user perms -- and squashed the hell
  out of it in the API.
a/m from Max --
  {simplerep,simplerep_html,simplerep_lout}.php3
  data/lout/{index.php3,sr_{defs,doc,langdefs,sheet}}
  lang/EN/{simplerep,simplerep_html,simplerep_lout}.php3.EN.inc
  lang/ES/{simplerep,simplerep_html,simplerep_lout}.php3.ES.inc
  lang/FR/{simplerep,simplerep_html,simplerep_lout}.php3.FR.inc
a added DE translation to LANGUAGES (I forgot!)
a added Opera for windows to BROWSERS

19991015 --
a from Max --
  lang/ES/{API,tos.php3}.ES.inc
  lang/FR/{API,tos.php3}.FR.inc

19991014 --
n Max said we are the biggest project using PHP -- can anyone verify this?
a/m from Max --
  simplerep.php3
  html.php3
  lang/{EN,FR,ES}/{simplerep,html}.php3.{EN,FR,ES}.inc
a Max added a module called html, which seems to give HTML "printed"
  output for certain things.
m more fixes to move_appointment.php3 -- now it updates properly, or so I
  think -- I haven't had time to test it yet.

19991013 --
n stupid unlucky 13th ;)
a added more icons, switched out some bad ones
m converted admin main menu to new icon-ized format. y'know, for the kids.
  (obscure reference, Hudsucker Proxy)
m moved main menu link into box, with cool back hand icon in admin.php3
m now no-one except root can reinit the database. pretty smart to do that,
  if anyone asks me.
a added iso-set.inc, which is the abstracted ISO set lookup table that
  formerly resided in global.var.inc, but I hate switches in config files.
a added show_appointments.php3 module -- needs patient and type to be able
  to show individual patients -- otherwise does days. need to implement
  facility security here.
d moved scheduler.php3 to old/ -- let me know where everything is broken.
m more mods and improvements to scheduling booking and showing...
m modified lang/EN/db_maintenance.php3.EN.inc for facility wording
a added $Export_Database to lang/EN/API.EN.inc
m modified Show Today tag in manage.php3 to work -- the question is, would
  we want it to show every appointment, or just this?
n NOTE TO SELF: remember to add check on duration possible in booking
  module if overbooking is disabled, so that you can't book a long appointment
  15 minutes before another. DON'T FORGET THIS!!
m now even if overbooking is turned on, an appointed space is put in italics
  to show that it is already taken, so that you have an idea what your
  schedule is like.
a added ability to change booking room from calendar, thereby making it
  much easier to peruse the selection of available timeslots... (this is
  in book_appointment.php3) with all appropriate language alterations.
a added patient name/dob display in the booking module -- makes more sense.
a added preliminary move_appointment module, which is basically a clone of
  the current book_appointment routine, but which I will work on.
a added $admin_level to global.var.inc, which I should have done _months_
  ago.
m fixed ridiculous error in mod form of facility module (where i forgot to
  end one of the tags.... *smacks self in forehead*)
m added some more in lang/EN/tos.php3.EN.inc -- translators take note!
n would like to look into moving the user level/description bar to the
  box bottom feature, and add the name in there as well ---
  well, anyways, I'm done for today. complain if you like, but i'm a huge
  fan of sleep.

19991012 --
a added icons to the img/ directory for the main menu. don't even ask why
  they aren't all there -- just send me some!!
m from Max, many improvements/translations of simple reports module
  (simplerep) and revision of documentation.
a from Max, new API function to display printers, along with definition in
  admin.php3 module...
m redid much of the main menu code, so that it looks much nicer with the
  icons, preserved [*] links for those with Lynx, so as not to make their
  displays too fugly.
n if any translators are interested, I have packaged tclbabel/tkbabel for
  Mandrake, which is great for simple translations, if you're not quite
  sure of a word. Please let me know.

19991010 --
m fixed call-in link to scheduler -> book_appointment with no action
  field.
m fixed display of past call-ins
m fixed links in book_appointment to not have action=addform...

19991008 --
a/m from Max:
  {specialties,simplerep}.php3
  lang/EN/{simplerep,admin,book_appointment}.php3.EN.inc

  lang/FR/{simplerep,admin,book_appointment,main}.php3.FR.inc
  lang/EN/doc/simplerep.php3.EN.html
m as per doc's instructions, modified week view in calendar API to
  generate 8 days instead of 7 -- today as well as a week ahead.
m fixed up lang/EN/doc/simplerep.php3.EN.html simple reports documentation
  ... will issue a documentation standard.
m fixed up some HTML code in simplerep.php3 for Max
a added code to encode the facility of a booking location into the scheduler
  which should have been done before, but wasn't because I am lazy.

19991007 --
m fixed following translation files (minor errors):
  lang/DE/main.php3.DE.inc
  lang/DE/call-in.php3.DE.inc
  lang/DE/db_maintenance.php3.DE.inc
m updated $ADD in cptmod.php3 to $lang_ADD
  also updated $ADD to $lang_ADD in freemed_display_actionbar (API)
m major fixed for tos.php3 so that it actually looks and functions
  properly and conforms to the language model.
m files from Max:
  {simplerep,phystatus,manage}.php3
  lang/EN/{API,{degrees,frmlry,phystatus,simplerep}.php3}.EN.inc
  lang/FR/{API,{degrees,frmlry,phystatus,simplerep,room}.php3}.FR.inc
  lang/ES/{API,{degrees,frmlry,phystatus,simplerep,room}.php3}.ES.inc
m fixed lack of TR tags in simplerep.php3
a added fc_interference_map_count to return whether there are or are not
  appointments in the interference map.
a added book_appointment.php3 from old scheduler routine, but working
  the calendar API into it. slow process.
m changed config db to accept VARCHAR(100) values up from CHAR(6) and
  added Calendar Overbooking option in admin.php3
m added more to lang/EN/admin.php3.EN.inc -- this is for all you
  translators out there...
a added lang/EN/book_appointment.php3.EN.inc
m modified manage.php3 to point to new booking routine
m fixed problems in admin, manage ...
n overbooking select does work, as does new booking -- note in future:
  do not end URLs with =, as KFM 1.1.2 doesn't do well with them
m modified admin.php3 scheduler definition to use TEXT for post-note --
  so that new routine can use it.
a added manage_appointments.php3, no language file yet. not operational
  yet either, but I'm working on it.
m check that -- manage_appointments actually displays appointments, but
  does not do any other maintenance work, yet. also, it has been linked to
  the View/Manage link for Appointments in Manage Patient (manage.php3)
m cleaned up manage.php3 HTML, mostly missing <CENTER> tag

19991006 (post release) --
a added img/tag-0.0.gif because I am bored -- integrated into index.php3
  with some corrections for alignment of the table (ALIGN=LEFT/RIGHT was
  not implemented all across)

19991006 --
a already, Max has translations for the physician_week_view module:
  lang/FR/physician_week_view.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/physician_week_view.php3.ES.inc
a and for yesterday's belated max contribution:
  admin.php3 (updated)
  facility.php3 (updated)
  global.var.inc (updated)
  simplerep.php3 (updated)
  lang/EN/{facility,simplerep}.php3.EN.inc
  lang/EN/doc/simplerep.php3.EN.inc
  lang/FR/{facility,simplerep}.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/{facility,simplerep}.php3.ES.inc
a another one, also from Max...
  lang/FR/{Rx,phy_avail_map}.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/{Rx,phy_avail_map}.php3.ES.inc
m fixed the bug in fc_display_week_calendar (accidentally used += instead
  of .= as shorthand for string concatenation, ended up with a 0)
a added week view in main.php3 for physicians (those with the physician
  identifier) and modified lang/EN/main.php3.EN.inc to boot (as in
  "additionally", not "start up")
n tested new main menu features -- seem to work fine, but i'd like some
  friendly icons in the near future...
  in that vien, I'm going to start moving the booking functions, etc
  out of the old scheduler into the new API'd scheduler. tomorrow.

19991005 --
m completed phy_avail_map.php3 module
m also completed lang/EN/phy_avail_map.php3.EN.inc
m finished roomequip.php3 module and lang/EN/roomequip.php3.EN.inc
a added day_of_the_week (this_date [YYYY-MM-DD], short form [T/F]) to the
  calendar API (freemed-calendar-functions.inc)
a added Johann's german (DE) translation, but no registry file, so it is
  identified as "German". this is a BIG!!! addition, because German is the
  3rd or 4th most popular language on the internet. in the lang/DE/doc/
  there are also beginning translations of the freemed site in german!!
a added physician_week_view.php3 and lang/EN/physician_week_view.php3.EN.inc
  but have no time to fix the stupid mapping bug -- will get to it later.

19991004 --
m added $Dosage in lang/EN/Rx.php3.EN.inc
m fixes/additions from Max Klohn (19991004):
  simplerep.php3
  lang/EN/user.php3.EN.inc
  lang/ES/user.php3.ES.inc
  lang/FR/user.php3.FR.inc
  lang/FR/main.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/main.php3.ES.inc
  lang/FR/physician_day_view.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/physician_day_view.php3.ES.inc
n sorry no release today -- not enough stuff. will release tomorrow, if
  middle management meetings (ugh!) allow.

19990930 --
m fixed huge bug in index.php3 not rebuilding the language registry,
  made freemed-rebuild-language-registry in scripts/ obsolete --
  index.php3 does it itself. freemed now ships with no language
  registry, and index.php3 builds it the first time you start up
  from the individual registry files.

19990929 --
m fixed the README.debian to work with newer configuration options.
m put in a $current_imap["key"] mapping on the interference map in
  freemed-calendar-functions.inc which keeps the date of the interference
  map to let you know what date it is for... also to let the program
  know that you have created a map.
a added fc_check_interference_map function to check the map for possible
  conflicts. the function checks to see if the proper map has been
  generated, and if not, calls fc_generate_interference_map.
a moved credits to separate file, to centrally give credits where credit
  is due.
m modified fc_display_day_calendar code to look nicer
a added physician_day_view.php3 and lang/EN/physician_day_view.php3.EN.inc
  files for the first part of the new scheduler, based on the calendar
  API in freemed-calendar-functions.inc
m modified fdb_fetch_array to return a null array instead of an error if
  it is called with a $result<1 (for bad queries, etc)
m fixed problems with freemed_check_access_for_{facility,patient} where
  they were expecting root to be user 0, when root is actually user 1.
a added $current_imap["count"] to keep track of how many appointments in
  the interference map -- and to print it at the top of the display,
  next to the date.
m names in interference map now link to the call-in and management displays
  for patients (in the fc_generate_interference_map function)
m many other little changes in the API to help speed things right along --
  mostly calendar API tweaks.
m added new field to user db to allow for mapping to doctor for actual
  physicians with mods to:
  main.php3
  admin.php3
  user.php3
  lang/EN/main.php3.EN.inc
  lang/EN/user.php3.EN.inc
  -- sorry you guys, but to use it, you're going to have to reinit!
n will someone remind me to translate the text in the calendar API?
  I haven't gotten a chance to do it yet...

19990928 --
a added the following updates from Mark L
  cpt.php3
  lang/EN/{cpt,icd9,user}.php3.EN.inc
a added the following updates from Max Klohn (god do I need CVS)
  simplerep.php3
  lang/EN/simplerep.php3.EN.inc
  lang/FR/simplerep.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/simplerep.php3.ES.inc
m very small language change to simplerep.php3
a added fc_generate_interference_map to freemed-calendar-functions.inc to
  generate the $current_imap array, which is an associative global array
  containing the appointments for a certain day. it will be used for the
  next generation set of scheduler modules to generate day information.
  A HREF tags, etc have not been added, just basic stuff for right now.
n update on John Gage's module -- he is recoding it for PHP3 to avoid any
  other hassles. until he commits it to the distribution, the java/
  directory will stay there.
m modified fc_generate_interference_map to also map the rest of the
  appointment in italics up until the ending.
m modified fc_starting_hour and fc_ending_hour to use global scope in
  freemed-calendar-functions.inc
m heavily modified fc_display_day_calendar to work with the new
  interference map routine (in freemed-calendar-functions.inc)

19990927 --
n back from the weekend, fresh and ready to code
a added nursing-plan.html to the code repository, for all those that want
  to see the prototype for it (thanks to Johann Krautinger j.krau@teleweb.at)
a added temporary java/ directory for John Gage's anesthesia applet
a added new icd9.php3 and lang/EN/icd9.php3.EN.inc files from mark l
  (lesswin@ibm.com), using the new template, to which I made a minor
  modification
a added following Max Klohn files:
  patient.php3
  simplerep.php3
  lang/EN/simplerep.php3.EN.inc
  lang/FR/simplerep.php3.FR.inc
  lang/ES/simplerep.php3.ES.inc
m made small language and form modifications to simplerep.php3 and
  lang/EN/simplerep.php3.EN.inc
a added scripts/cfg-value, which allows other languages to pull config
  variables out of global.var.inc (like Perl, Java, Bash, etc)... called
  from package root directory like:  scripts/cfg-value (actual-value)
m moved icd9.php3.old to old/
m created specs/ directory without index for any upcoming specs that are
  to be implemented, before they are put into table form.
n very busy today. i hope we get CVS soon?

19990924 --
n just got back from the Toronto Summit, with plenty of fresh ideas.
  I met a lot of great people, and the doc and I have some pics of the
  entire crew for you all to see, just as soon as we have the spare time
  to pull them off the camera and put them up (* how I love gPhoto! *)
a tarball from Max with changes to: (19990923)
  patient.php3
  lang/EN/patient.php3.EN.inc

m added line to freemed_check_access_for_facility to allow non-facility
  specific patients to be processed (true by default)

  work phone # field to produce a blank home phone # field
m brought the room.php3 module to fdb_ wrapper compliance (finally)
a added lang/EN/room.php3.EN.inc with appropriate changes and massive
  cleanup in room.php3

a added access checking for the patient record in prescription module (Rx)
a added lang/EN/Rx.php3.EN.inc with appropriate changes to Rx module
m fixed accidental inclusion of french into lang/EN/patient.php3.EN.inc
  by Max...
n at the Toronto conference, I talked to John Gage about integrating his
  modular java-based anesthesia tracking and report program, and putting
  it into freemed. we both agreed that it would be mutually beneficial,
  and the modified version will be committed to the tree as soon as John
  sends it to me. please don't complain until I patch the code. (note:
  I will be using guavac to compile from the source, and will be writing
  a PHP wrapper, for security's sake)

19990922 --
d deleted old mk-19990921.tar accidentally left in distro for yesterday
a added/updated the following files, courtest of Max Klohn:

           progress_notes,roomequip,call-in}.ES.inc
  lang/EN/call-in.php3.EN.inc
a added persistant page recall -- if you hit the X to logout, it will
  remember where you were, in case you log back in immediately. it
  needed lang/EN/index.php3.EN.inc to be updated, but it asks if you
  want to resume or not. also changed authenticate.php3, the
  freemed_display_box_top function, index.php3, authenticate.php3 and
  logout.php3 ... did I miss any?
d removed main_phy.php3 setting in authenticate. will use loadable parts
  from main.php3 so as not to have to reinvent the wheel. (now in old/)

m cleaned up some HTML in admin.php3
m fixed gfx config var not getting passed in admin.php3 (thanks Max)
a implemented ISO 8859-x support for all languages I could find (50+)...
  we are now ready for non-western languages, etc, if someone would only
  fill in what is missing. possibly move all language loader code to a
  separate inc file called by global.var.inc, since they really aren't
  just global variables anymore...
m fixed global/local scope problem in API's freemed_display_actionbar
  with $page_name -> $this_page_name for local scope (thanks Chris)
m fixed $coded_by scope in freemed_display_html_bottom
a added feature to select Old/All/Current call-ins to call-in.php3
  and added those new words to lang/EN/call-in.php3.EN.inc

19990920 --

n done for the weekend -- or am I? I'll be putting all of my weekend
  additions and changes into the log, so that Monday's release is great.
  mainly more features to show at the Minoru Development-sponsored
  Open Source Medical Management Conference in Toronto. The doc and I
  (perhaps Chris Beggy also?) will be attending. Wish us luck!

19990915 --
a added fm_button function to generate button with text
a added generate_button.php3 module to generate buttons on the fly --
  will someone fix it to work with the sizes we are working with?
m test implementation of the aforementioned new module in user.php3
  menu... will get back later...

19990914 --
a yesterday added PT (portuguese) translation. releasing today.

19990910 --

  with, flame, etc
a added lang/EN/simplerep.php3.EN.inc for Max Klohn's excellent
  simple reports module (someone translate me!)

  $darker_bgcolor instead in progress_notes.php3
a added $record_name to progress_notes.php3 and propagated changes
  throughout the module
a added script to use txt2pdf to convert the API into a PDF file
  when the distribution is packed -- I know you will all appreciate
  this, for ease of printing if nothing else.
a added progress_notes.php3.EN.inc in lang/EN/ for all you closet
  translators out there...

19990909 --
n going to the Open Source Medical Management Summit in Toronto, CA
  on the 22nd-23rd to represent freemed with the doc. and we are also
  meeting with the VP of Marketing for Merallis.Net (providing
  insurance billing) about possible modules, etc. very exciting.
a added user type feature for separate menus for physicians, etc.
  also means check lang/EN/user.php3.EN.inc for new things, etc
a added routine to check usertype if LoginCookie part 1 > 1 and
  if it is a physician, bring up the main_phy.php3 menu instead of
  the regular main menu.
m fixed two mysql_ refs in main.php3 to the fdb_ db wrapper
a been implementing basic current_patient cookie to hold the current
  patient through multiple menus, actions, etc (persistance) ...
  now currently implemented in patient.php3 (mostly) and manage.php3
  (somewhat)
a added a global LoginCookie to freemed_auth_login to pass the cookie
  var back to be used (called SessionLoginCookie, for temp session
  until refresh from browser).
m changed things around to try to keep main.php3 and main_phy.php3
  from biting each other. will have to write exceptions for links.

19990907 --
a added freemed-calendar-functions.inc library, which I am pulling
  functions from the scheduler to complete, so that booking, etc
  functions can be put into other modules

19990903 --
n sorry about the lack of productivity, but I have been busy setting
  up the CVS server and locking down my box. feel free to ask me for
  CVS access if you would like to help develop the freemed project.

19990830 --
a two language bundles from our good friend Max Klohn, plus updates
  to call-in and the defs in admin for a physician to be specified.
n sorry for not releasing for 5 days -- I've been busy. also, my
  machine has been under attack, so until people knock it off, I've
  locked down all the services besides Apache on my machine.
a added check for facility's default physician to appear initially
  selected in call-in menu -- finally! I used that field!
m fixed typo in freemed_check_access_for_facility so that it actually
  works.
m modified $All_patients -> $All_Patients in patient.php3.EN.inc --
  translators please take note
m minor fix to freemed_display_phy_degrees
a added freemed_display_phy_specialties
a added fields in admin.php3 def of physician db to allow for degrees
  and specialties
m modified physician.php3 to work with new db defs

19990825 --
a added link in db_maintenance.php3 for physician specialties
a added &nbsp; to specialties.php3 to have description part of table
  render properly in Netscape if there was no description
a added same fix to _TEMPLATE_, cptmod, cpt
a fixed inscogroup module to work with mods/adds and LoginCookie
m cleaned up links in manage.php3
m reworking call-in code to scheduler.php3
n now it is possible to book call-ins, but it requires a db reinit,
  since i added another field to the scheduler db code.
m changed HTML header to include link colors in BODY tag

19990824 --
a added specialties.php3, which has real specialties as opposed to degrees
  which are now in degrees.php3 -- sheesh! also updated admin.php3 with 
  proper definition, etc. they have a name, description and date stamp
  for add/modify.
a added $Adding to lang/EN/API.EN.inc
a big change -- added call-in.php3, which allows patients to be "called in"
  without being entered in the actual master database. the trick is that
  there is an option called "enter" in the menu which allows them to be
  transfered into the main patient db, with all of the entered contact info
  intact. good for certain things. suggested by the doc.
m changed bottom links in box in patient.php3 and added temp links in
  main.php3 for call-in module
a added facility access check for call-in module
n the woman will leave me here if I don't leave now, so I'm done for the
  day. -- jeff

19990823 --
m changed ptmarital statuses from 1 letter to multiples (single, etc), and
  added $Separated language variable
n been working on the doc's additions...
m changed specialty.php3 -> degrees.php3 with all other changes and
  mysql -> fdb conversion in prefixes
m kludge fix for help.php3, since I broke it somehow
m moved freemed_display_phy_specialties -> freemed_display_phy_degrees
  and updated the select code
m fixed references to specialties -> degrees in physician.php3
n I'm cooked for today. Please send mods, etc to me...

19990822 --
n not much here -- just max's fix
m added Max's translations for {user,index,main}.php3
m fixed break in authenticate.php3 due to negligence

19990820 --
m fixed some more language things in patient.php3
a added $record_name to lang/??/(module).??.inc files, at least for
  english... this makes basically everything interchangeable
a added facility ($_f) select box to index.php3, as well as making
  language adjustments for it.
m modified freemed_display_facilities function, cleaned up the
  deadwood in freemed_open_db (like the <!-- -->) and added cookie
  repeating code.
m after many many hours of reviewing code, i used the global keyword
  to scope the default_value cookie... and all was well.
n if I may digress -- we recently have had a minor falling out between
  developers. as part of the GNU community, producing community-written
  software, which we wholeheartedly believe is as good, if not better
  than commercially written softeare, we should know better than to let
  petty arguments escalate into full scale flaming wars. please think
  about what you say before you say it, or we may lose good developers
  and designers, as well as good friends. now, i'm climbing off of my
  miniature pulpit, and going back to what we started to do in the
  first place -- code!
a added capability for freemed_display_rooms to check for the facility
  perms (good for booking) and to check $default_facility as passed from
  the cookie. also updated all these in the API.
m changed bugs address in global.var.inc to code_bugs@test.pr.uconn.edu,
  where I will be answering bug problems.
a added null length check on facilities display function in the
  freemed-functions.inc file (gets rid of annoying brackets)

19990819 --
n most of today's modifications will be for the upcoming db.freemed.org
  site -- sorry to everyone who expected anything else...
m modified cpt.php3 to have an export function
m modified template to have export function
m modified cptmod.php3 to be up to date (no more "include boxhead"s or
  anything like that) and added an export function...
a added import functions to most stock databases in admin.php3
a moved _facilitylist.php3 to old/

19990818 --
a added check in patient.php3 to see if patient is accessable by the
  current user, and if not, it doesn't display that patient.
a created lang/reg directory, with self title language file (like
  "EN" for english) with a single line, like "EN:English"... there
  is a script which is called by freemed in the scripts/ directory
  called scripts/freemed-refresh-language-registry which rebuilds
  the lang/reg/registry file from all of the language registry files.
  freemed does this automatically if there is no lang/reg/registry
  file.
m now all of the languages actually show up in the list box at logon
  and properly return to the global.var.inc value upon exit.
m updated index.php3 with language things, etc...
a forgot to mention -- added scripts/ directory for shell or perl
  scripts that glue things together.
a added freemed_check_access_for_facility function --- like the
  freemed_check_access_for_patient, but much simpler, just checking
  access for facilities -- i put it in mainly for the scheduler, but
  I can see where else it could be used.
a added image_handler.php3 to retrieve images from a repository to
  be used in here -- would be very useful for handling Xray photos,
  once I write the module --- ;) it takes a loc (or "location") param
  which specifies an alias in image.conf (which I will eventually move
  to a cfg/ directory) and an image parameter to specify the image
  name. if someone can fix the # comment checking, I'd be much
  obliged...
a added displayday action in scheduler to show current day with optional
  passthru of $patient variable
a added link in manage.php3 to show current day (link to scheduler
  displayday action) with added var in lang/EN/manage.php3.EN.inc ...
  please translate !!
a added $physical_loc variable to global.var.inc, to aid in physical
  file imports, etc
m moved default language to $default_language, which is pulled into
  $language variable if there is no valid one specified in the logon
a added a data/ directory for stock data to be sent with it, plus
  language subdirectories for importing data. with routine in
  API (freemed_import_stock_data).
a added freemed_export_stock_data function to allow exporting of stock
  data for gnuCPT or such projects to provide "shipping" data for not
  only freemed, but for other GPL'd medical projects.
d finally removed some deadwood from specialty.php3
a added link to specialty.php3 in menu to export data ... as a test of
  the export function. it seems to export nicely, in a comma delimited
  format.
m redid admin module additions to make it readable... finally
a added data/EN/specialty.EN.data to show what exports/imports do...
n done for the day -- and WHAT a day it was...

19990817 --
n back to work -- trying to get _something_ done.
a added freemed_check_access_for_patient function, which checks the
  perms from the user module to see if the user is allowed access to
  that particular patient. will have to add checks for that in all
  patient related modules. also, all facilities and scheduling modules
  will need another, related function, to see if the user has perms for
  that facility. will build into display_facilities listing function,
  etc, but not today. today is getting this out.
a added support for selectable lanugages with default still being
  $language in global.var.inc, but carried as a cookie (u_lang var
  in cookie) ... still need to make a language registry from which to
  pull ... maybe just searching lang/ for two character names, then
  requiring an informational file... like lang/EN/language.name or
  something equally dumb. eh. 
m modified english language files for index.php3 with two new words
  Default and Language for anyone nosy enough to ask... translate!
  translate!

19990815 --
m put in proper begin bracket for else statement in manage.php3 to
  avoid premature ending of switch/case statement (thanks Max)

19990814 --
a added t (transgender) option to gender in patient.php3 (Max, remember
  to add $Transgender in the lang/??/... file for patient.php3)
m updated the ENUM definition in admin.php3 for transgender change
m fixed Max's caps in 1st gender pulldown...

19990813 --
n Oh No! Friday the 13th!?!?!?
a (Chris Beggy) added lang/EN/doc/frmlry.php3.EN.html documentation
m (Max Klohn) all user/manage language modules updated, and
  simple reports and the actual management module updated
a (Chris Beggy) added freemed.db database dump for those who want
  to know a little more, but don't want to reinit...
n for once, everyone else did 100x more than I did on a release --
  maybe because it's Fri 13? ;) I'll fix the scheduler next week.

19990812 --
n I've _got_ to start remembering to release. I keep leaving work early
  and forgetting to tar and send -- oops?
a added IT (italian) language file translations from Stefano
  (ste@sirius.ccii.unipi.it) to the distribution!! (another day, another
  lanugage)
m fixed typo in admin.php3 where Creating_new_db was missing $ prefix
a added button in user.php3 to try again if passwords don't match for
  addition. $Try_Again lang variable added.
a added freemed_multiple_choice to the API to assist in multiple choice
  SELECT boxes.
m fixed lingering mysql_ functions in user.php3
m updated phymi to phymname, changed types on name vars to VARCHAR 50s
  to allow for longer physician names
m added capability for facility, physican and physician group authoriziation
  from user database using freemed_multiple_choice function.
m moved all references in physician.php3 to use new lengths and new
  phymname field instead of phymi field.
m modified fm_value_in_array to correctly see first element [0]
a added a "return to user menu" link at the bottom of the modify screen
  in the user.php3 module

19990811 --
n I didn't release on my birthday. Oops.
m Max modified a whole bunch of things in patient.php3, and so
  did I, after I got it back. patient data reordered in forms
  <BR><BR> converted to <P> in some places, menus redone in a nicer
  fashion. more...
m <Max) display_insco line for tertiary insurance was showing secondary...
m (Max) fixed gender updating in modform action.
a (Max) added language translations for EN, FR, ES for patient.php3
m lots of other things in patient.php3 -- mostly removing deadwood.

19990810 --
n it's my birthday. yay me.
m moved to fdb_ from mysql_ convention in progress_notes.php3
  (thanks to Max for pointing this one out)
a added simplereport table to admin.php3 (thanks to Max Klohn
  again for outlining the table, etc)
a added simplerep.php3 module, written by Max Klohn, as well
  as a mod to the db_maintenance.php3 module and translations
  for the Patient Management menu (manage.php3)

19990809 --
n updated MySQL to v3.22.25, and now the scheduler works ... hm.
a reintegrated scheduler module from old/ to main distribution.
m added calduration field to scheduler to allow for multiple
  duration visits/appointments.
a added rudimentary routine for determining previous booking in
  certain rooms. need to add a configuration variable to allow
  the end user to decide whether that is neccessary or not.
m implemented fdb_ convention in scheduler.php3 and manage.php3
n need to add checking for links for adding appointments and
  conflict checking for hours (:00) links
n mental note: add extra param to physician list function to
  allow for listings only by physician group, etc
m Max Klohn changed the SP to ES for spanish, as well as
  modifying the proper entry in LANGUAGES
d removed old/opendb.php3, old/main.php3.old, old/_actionbar.php3
  old/box{head,foot}.php3, old/head.php3, old/tail.php3 from the
  distribution.
n should probably remove "NO ROOM SELECTED" error code, since it
  should allow a no preference booking if there is no room 
  specified

19990807 --
m fixed problem with phygroup.php3 serving up more than one
  freemed_display_box_top in the modform section (thanks Max)
m changed $user=="root" to freemed_get_userlevel($LoginCookie)>
  $delete_level in facility.php3 main view (also thanks Max)
n identified global.var.inc and other inc file problem via viewing
  as text files... adding .inc to the list of associations for
  the php3 mime type in srm.conf for Apache or modifying the
  .htaccess file fixes this.
a added translations for index.php3 and authenticate.php3 as
  well as updates, all by the incredible Max Klohn!!
m updated README with instructions for the AddType patch for
  Apache. also updates the "thanks" list on the guilty parties
  part of the README

19990805 --
a sorry no great new features, but Max did send in the translations
  into spanish and english for the user module, as well as the
  user mods, which I guess are the only fixes/mods/features for
  today. sorry. -- jeff

19990804 --
a added files for main.php3 with language support from Max Klohn,
  with proper French and Spanish translations
a added date of birth search support and ordering support in
  patient.php3
a added cellphone and pager number support into physican module,
  along with moving to fdb_ functions from mysql_ functions
  (the database changes for physician are in admin, reinit!)
a added language calls to freemed-functions.inc (API) so that the
  functions will correctly pull in the language information. BTW:
  I added many other things to the API.$language.inc file, so it
  will have to be redone for all languages other than english...
m fixed small non-language compliant bug in API (DEBUG IS ON needed
  to be put into a variable in one instance).
m patched the help.php3 file to death
a added full documentation support through HTML based help files in
  subdirectories of the language directories. only a default document
  and a test page for the main menu doc are currently present in the
  lang/EN/doc subdir -- more when I get to it.
n maybe more stuff -- who knows? I was busy ;)

19990803 --
a added CORRECT french for what I had done as well as spanish, thanks
  to Max Klohn!
m moved boxhead.php3 and boxfoot.php3 to old/ until I decide to remove
  them permanently -- let's see what breaks...
a lang/EN/main.php3.EN.inc, lang/EN/API.EN.inc (with fixed comment
  header from yesterday), lang/EN/manage.php3.EN.inc added and
  freemed-functions.inc, main.php3 and manage.php3 all now language
  independant!
a added LANGUAGES file with EN, FR and SP definitions -- should I
  use ES for spanish instead of SP???
m modified KFM browser entry in BROWSERS to reflect success I've had
  today with it.
a Max comes through again! I've now got an admin.php3 and all three
  language files from him, which are in today's distro. minor mods
  in adding "$SELECTED" and "$DEFAULT"...
m had to add lines for the internal functions to give them access to
  the language files -- must finish in tomorrows' release

19990802 --
m changed "BAD!!" message in authenticate.php3 to much more pleasing
  message concerning lack of access. enough people didn't like the
  simple yet effective "BAD!!"  ...
a began to add basic multiple language support
m overhauled index.php3 to allow for multiple language support, as
  well as modifications to freemed-functions.inc
a added lang/EN and lang/FR directories for language modules. the
  file format for the language loader is pretty simple. I'll convert
  the modules as soon as I can. BTW to all french speakers -- I'm
  sorry, I haven't taken french in years, and I know that "DEBUG EST
  ICI?" is _not_ "debug on"... I just needed to test it! honest!

19990730 --
m added ptdob field to the display on the management module, as per
  request of Max.

19990728 --
n I've been falling behind in putting up the tarballs, but I've had an
  _extremely_ busy and crazy weekend, and I'd like to think it's over,
  but it keeps coming back to bite me in the arse. Anyways, on to the
  CHANGES.
m added ptcountry field to patient record (thanks Max (was it Max??))...
  side note : don't _ever_ code for too long, or you'll start using
  recursive parentheses. &lt; g &gt;
m added ptnextofkin BLOB field for next of kin information in the
  patient db, with addslashes and htmlentities where appropriate.
n I'm sorry that I didn't get any more work done today, but I was busy
  taking a certification exam and stomping out fires. The problem is
  between the keyboard and the chair.

19990727 --
n did some work on the 26th, but not anything _extremely_ noteworthy
  so I left it out. go figure.
m modified _TEMPLATE_.php3 to have add section, enabled by variable
  in the top of the form. Also modified formulary module to use separate
  add form.

19990725 --
m tried to change modifying form format for inscogroups module as a
  test... it should be neat, but I'm not promising anything.
n I've taken a look at some of the HL7/XML interchange format stuff,
  and I think I'm going to take a whack at integrating some of it
  myself.

19990723 --
a implemented fdb_last_record function to let the user know what
  the last record inserted was.
a added table definitions for rx table (Rx.php3 module) in admin.php3
m working on Rx (prescription db)... got most everything except modify
  and delete working. mostly fleshing out needs to be done, links to
  formulary db are done (yes Chris, I know it took a little longer
  than we would have liked)... also just general debugging.
a added $http variable (http for regular, https for SSL HTTPD...)
a added freemed_display_drugs to API
m fixed minor bug in procedure module, line 387
m fixed display bug in procedure module
a added the prescriptions stuff to the patient management module
  (manage.php3), thereby setting it out for all you wolves to toy with.
m fixed lingering problem with redirect by removing superfluous /
  in the bounced URL and removing the authentication to allow use of
  the Location: HTTP/1.1 header.

19990722 --
m revamped the API file to reflect the fact that I actually care
  about it instead of letting it gather dust in a corner.
a added a set of miscellaneous functions, mostly functions to allow
  multiple selections of items via BLOB fields in databases.
m changed naming convention in procedure database to procXXXX
  instead of "homage-to-crappy-Medical-Manager" addpro convention.
  this unfortunately requires a database reinit. lucky i thought of
  this before the freeze.
a added freemed_display_cptcodes and freemed_display_cptmods
  functions to freemed-functions.inc, to allow for CPT codes and
  modifers pulldowns. (i would have done it earlier, but i forgot,
  and now i needed it for the procedure module...)
a implemented SQL Abstraction Library (SAL) code parts from
  px.skylar.com written by Gianugo Rabellino <nemorino@opera.it>
  to fix ODBC connectivity and add msql connectivity -- mostly.
  not all of the msql calls have been implemented, so it should be
  considered moderately broken.
m added lcase() to fdb_ abstraction functions to allow for stupids
  who don't know how to let go of the shift key when changing the
  config files... ;)
m modified the patient database to include insurance companies -- 
  now how in the world did I gloss over that one for 2+ months?
m minor rebuilding of links between the patient and procedure
  databases -- now the ICD codes and guarantor are passed across
  for safekeeping. now i just need to put in the treatment db and
  make the other 95% of everything work right &lt; g &gt;...
m changed the TTs to STDFONTs in the physician module, and removed
  the legacy searchform action.

19990721 --
m increased maximum count of patient record names (f/m/l) to 50 chars
n please submit any changes, as the database is being prepared for
  a freeze.
a added function freemed_log to log actions, upon demands of the
  general populace, along with definition in admin.php3 -- gentleman,
  reinitialize your databases...
m took out all mysql_ type functions in admin.php3 and replaced them
  with their fdb_ equivalents, and changed an instance of $mysql_db_pw
  to $db_password
m changed <TT>s to STDFONT type tags in user.php3 and specialty.php3
a added freemed_display_insco function for insurance company pulldowns
m major overhaul of procedure module for usefulness and functionality,
  linking in with patient management menu (manage.php3) and trying to
  bring it up to specs...
m modified format of manage.php3 to accomodate more items. (yes, my
  spelling is atrocious, but that is the least of my concerns)
n still modifying procedure database so as to be useful -- please don't
  complain until it is done. I left some notes for myself in the add
  section, but haven't finished the delete or modify sections, as well
  as having to take out a whole load of fields that are too fscking
  redundant. more tomorrow -- until then, keep watching the skies.

19990719 --
m incorporated new revisions of formulary (frmlry) module from Chris
  Beggy, and modifed the db to have date add/mod tags

19990716 --
a due to overwhelming popular demand, I have added a date-of-birth
  field in the patient database.
m changed all mysql_ references in patient.php3 to fdb_ refs.
n please note that the db change will NOT require a reinit. due to
  an oversight on my part, there was already a ptdob record, but I
  forgot to put it in the form -- you don't have to reinit your dbs.
n just tested freemed with Mozilla M8 -- and it works. check for a
  screenshot at ftp://test.pr.uconn.edu/pub/freemed-project/snapshots/

19990715 --
a added $ADD, $MOD, and $DEL to the global.var.inc file, to facilitate
  easier transition to a graphical format like that.
a added a view function to the progress notes... and set up paths back
  to the modify, but not the delete yet, since I'm pretty sure I haven't
  written a delete routine yet.
n will whoever continually wipes my database, please stop! I have to use
  this, and reinitializing my database means I have to recreate the
  webuser so that no one complains. Please stop, or I will change the
  root password.

19990714 --
m _MAJOR_ change: db wrappers now implemented. they are in the style of
  the mysql functions (i.e. mysql_create_db -> fdb_create_db) with the
  notable exception that pconnect has been mapped to connect (in other
  words mysql_pconnect is now referenced by fdb_connect) to save time
  in case I wanted to rescind the entire pconnect thing.
n I'm not sure whether anything other than MySQL works properly, since
  I have just added them. So far I have put in ODBC, PostgreSQL and
  MySQL.
m reorganized and clarified the global.var.inc file so that it doesn't
  look quite so imposing.
m Majorly redid template with new db wrappers... still need to change
  <TT> tags to <$STDFONT_B>,etc tags...
a added Formulary module from Chris Beggy, who has become the first
  non-me coder to contribute to the master code base. Thanks, but don't
  let that discourage anyone else ;) -- it's called frmlry.php3 and
  is referenced through db maintenance...
m bunch of usability improvements to _TEMPLATE_.php3
m did the <TT> -> $STDFONT_x conversion on both the _TEMPLATE_ and the
  frmlry.php3...
m removed _ref cookie set in frmlry module, since it is a "dead end"
  module, and doesn't link out.

19990709 --
m major overhaul to the patient module, including new STDFONT_B/E tags
  and split phone #s... some broken links fixed, other links added for
  conveniences as I found them. db structure slightly modified, and
  add/modify condensed to the beginning of the db as ptdtadd/ptdtmod,
  as well as all personal data being moved to the top of the form, and
  some fields enlarged to be easier to enter.
m slight modifications to the progress_notes and manage modules in
  accordance with the aforementioned modifications.
a added structures for payment records (for checks, etc) to the admin
  module. stupid db reinit -- you go squish now.
a added prelim payment records module -- working on addition function
  now.
a added billing function from main menu with billing_functions module.
n these functions are not ready for prime-time yet. please do not wail
  on them then complain that they don't work ;) -jeff

19990708 --
n Put out the possibility of using db wrappers instead of mysql calls
  to allow people to change db backends at will.
m changed the progress_notes (pnotes db) structure to include
  industry standard progress notation (four part)
m fixed major stupid in patient module -- action=find would return
  last name and first name swapped positions, due to typo.
d commented out stupid mysqladmin path in global.var.inc, due to
  rehashed auth scheme removing the need for more users...
m minor modifications to the manage patient code to incorporate the
  progress notes...
m progress notes module -- main "manage" screen, hopefully a delete
  and print view/email view option...
n current progress notes main screen links to modify, rather than
  view...
m fixed problem with parsing of date split in progress notes modify
  screen (action=modform).
m way too many more changes and additions to progress notes for me to
  list...
n updated BROWSERS with kfm problems & new version of Netscrape. have
  added TODO...
n tomorrow I restructure the patient db and hopefully still have time
  to hash out the payments structures... g'night.

19990707 --
n I've been off for a while, but I'm back and coding at full tilt. I 
  have added a prescription module (Rx.php3) which is not ready, and
  will depend on a drug module which I haven't done yet. I am also
  working on a patient notes set of routines to work from the patient
  management menu... just a bunch of blobs, but will be fine.
a added prescription module skeleton to distribution (Rx.php3)
a added progress notes skeleton to distribution (progress_notes.php3)
  which I am currently fleshing out
m removed user pull-in routine from reinit in admin module, due to
  modified authentication scheme
a added pnotes db (patient notes) to admin module
m modified manage module (patients management) to show which links are
  broken and not, added select another patient option at the bottom,
  and began to implement $STDFONT_B,$STDFONT_E tags.
n stopped in the middle of Rx.php3 and progress_notes.php3, but will
  resume tomorrow...

19990702 --
n Yesterday was bizarrely busy, but I'd like to take this opportunity
  to welcome aboard Tim Cook, of the FreePM project, who has
  decided to help us out. We were also added to the Littlefish
  project contributors list as a cooperating project.

19990701 --
n FreePM has an article in LWN, but we are still pressless, to my
  knowledge. They are using the same format we are, and Ryan has
  inquired as to whether they are interested in collaboration.
m begun to implement new user auth scheme with MD5 (no more clear
  text security!)
m made "old" subdirectory for old modules and pseudo-functions, so
  that they aren't deleted if something new comes along.
m implemented authentication scheme -- seems to work, but haven't
  tried it with a new implementation, so I'm not sure if the "user
  1=root, pw=db passwd" hack is going to do.
n there is a developer's board up at test.pr.uconn.edu/freemed-board
  in case anyone wants to know what is going on, and to discuss
  everything.
a added separate user module to handle the user db, accessable only
  as root.
m modified template for new logon scheme...
m got user forms and users other than root to be able to use the
  program... also checked to see if it would work clean, and the
  program seems to allow root in without an authentication database,
  using the database password as the root password.
n please note that the user menu is _ONLY_ accessable by root. not
  even others with userlevel=9.
m centered the admin menu link on the main menu.
m monkeyed around with the _ref cookie, and got the menu chain to
  work a _little_ better.
a added HEADERFONT_B, HEADERFONT_E, STDFONT_B, and STDFONT_E to the
  global.var.inc module to help out consistancy in fonts...
m _MAN_ have I been busy today! Redid the main menu in a more
  flow-oriented scheme, then began to rip apart the admin module.
m scudged out the ICD, facility and cptmod modules for some old
  "legacy" crappe that I forgot I left there.

19990629/30 --
n Stupid changelogs... you go squish now. I have not remembered to
  do tarballs/releases or changelogs for the past three days now,
  mainly due to incredible sloth, but also due to my heavy workload.
a added the addform action in the CPT module
a started a TOS (type of service) module, to go with the CPT module,
  since it depends on them. I don't have the db structure from the
  doc yet, so I can't really do much concerning that. more when it
  happens. did anyone see the article on the project?

19990627 --
n it's after midnight on the night of the 26th, so I guess it's the
  27th. i have _got_ to get a life.
m fixed template problems with not checking for userlevel.
m cpt module well in the works... has dependency on TOS (type of
  service) simple db. must remember to do this.
n D'oh! I forgot to put an action=addform case in the _TEMPLATE_,
  which propagated to the CPT codes db. Must fix... Must fix...
a added an "Add Patient" option on the main patient module screen,
  to calm the rising tide of complaints I'm sure I would get.

19990625 --
n sorry everyone, i've been really busy, but here goes.
a created cpt database.
a created physican group database (phygroup) to handle problem of
  accounting by groups of docs and perms of users to do so.
m added field to reference phygroup in user record.
n should add something to add all of the system users into the db
  at reinit... currently dumps all but root into level 5, and
  puts root into level 9. also displays user description in main
  screen along with level (mental note: in future, add a display
  bar like that to the bottom of all boxes?)
a patched template for some stupid errors.
m far overdue, MASSIVE overhaul of facility module, including
  conformance to the API. phone & fax formatting to come.
m did phone and fax in add, must do modify splits and recombines.
m minor main.php3 modification.

19990622 --
m heavy db modifications to patient table -- please reinit. ptmi ->
  ptmname, VC(15), and ptlname,ptfname -> VC(15), thanks to Ryan Losh
  for this bugfix. now people like E Frank Shermheiler will be fine ;)
m changed detachment of dependants of new dependant to linking to the
  new guarantor. if you think i'm speaking greek, it probably doesn't
  matter too much.
m fixed _really_ dumb error, whereby asking for the guarantors to be
  displayed resulted in the dependants being displayed... ($id ->
  $ptdep for f1 in the link)
m heavily patched physician module (physician.php3) to include states
  for primary and secondary addresses. the patch is also in admin.php3,
  and requires a reinit to take effect.
m fixed problem with bottom links in patient module by adding a
  $record_name definition for API compatibility, and allowing a link
  back to the module default page if $_ref points to it.

19990619 --
a added README.debian from our good friend Ryan
a/m did credits change/addition. if you should be listed here, please
  let me know. also, if more people begin to help, the credits will
  be separated into a "CREDITS" file.
q is anyone interested in doing documentation on getting started,
  past the actual code set up -- like initializing the db, etc?
m fixed broken extra freemed_display_box_top in manage.php3
a heavy additions to the management module (manage.php3), including
  dependant attachment/detachment, with smart capabilities (i.e. it
  will disconnect all dependants of a former guarantor if they become
  dependants. should i modify this to make them become dependants of
  the new guarantor? i need some feedback on this one.
n TODO -- must add a checkbox to the attach to guarantor thing so that
  the address, other information CAN be cloned if neccesary. if not,
  it can be an option in the config -- i don't know. also, when
  making "new dependant" from the patient menu, should pull address,
  phone data from the guarantor as defaults... set by config variable.

19990618 --
n I have to do some kind of campus tour thing as part of my day job,
  so not much is happening today... just tweaks, no major revelations.
m heavily cleaned the patient module, taking out most of the action
  loop parts that will _never_ be used.
a show all patients find option ("all") in patient find menu.
m finished commenting out old includes in patient module
a added guarantor and dependant searches from their respective
  dependants and guarantors, from the view menu in the patient
  find result screen (patient module). no, I haven't forgotten how
  to speak in proper english.
m somehow broke manage function from patient menu... will analyze and
  fix by next release.

19990617 --
n been very busy with other things (work related), so not much has
  been done. just minor API updates, fixes to existing modules. will
  someone tell me why KFM 1.1.1 is having problems again?
n website should be on DNS servers sometime this evening, according
  to Chris and Ryan. hopefully we'll pick up a few more coders. make
  my life easer.... ;)
m updated phystatus module with API
d deleted "select" action from room module
m updated room module with API
d deleted old default index for room module (mostly housecleaning
  today...)
m cleaned up ICD code db... still haven't converted to new table
  format for add/mod/del
m changed location of </TABLE> in view part of _TEMPLATE_, to allow
  for actual display... sorry all you developers out there!
m started to implement actual patient interface (searching, etc)...
  i have _not_ added a "show all patients" option, with criteria
  "add", but that will come soon. This module needs a lot of
  overhaul.

19990616 --
n forgot to do tarball yesterday. [hits head against wall]
a added date handling procedures for previous and next day, which
  strangely seem to work, and began to implement the add appointment
  action in the scheduler. i need graphics for skipping around, as
  the text looks really ugly. multiple steps might be needed to do
  this...
a added book appointment link to modify patient screen, mostly as
  as test to be sure the linking works.
m fixed open_db function so that it refreshes cookies... but now all
  things must have freemed_open_db ($user, $pw) called before any
  other function, or PHP3 will warning you to death.
m begun fixing warnings due to revised refreshes on authentication.
n NOTE TO SELF -- patient and facility modules are _far_ out of
  whack and need to be brought up to snuff.
n I think I whacked MySQL on my development system. I'm not sure
  what happened or why, but I may consider advising an upgrade to
  3.22.23 if this happens again. The mysqld ended as soon as it was
  brought back up.
a scheduling has barebones functionality, but moving (rescheduling)
  appointments, deleting, and changing needs to be put in... this is
  really going to kill.
q (this is a general query...) who wants to begin on the accounting
  and management side? I've been implementing general dbs, and now
  scheduling, but I need people to fill in the gaps. this is quite
  far from completion now, but I would like people to volunteer for
  0.1 functionality parts. also, if you are an active coder, please
  tell me, and i will add you to this file or a credits file when
  we warrant one.
m oops... almost forgot to update the _TEMPLATE_.php3 for everyone
  with the changed authentication order.
n MySQL crashes every time an addition to the calendar table is
  attempted. Trying to figure out why.

19990615 --
m changed the changelog format (a=add, m=modify, d=delete, n=notify)
m changed some more dbs over to the new API
a added some new API functionality
m finished up the template (_TEMPLATE_.php3) module for people to
  get cracking on dbs.
n the doc and I had an interview for Inside Healthcare magazine
  about the project. the issue is coming out June 28th, so we
  should have a page up, and some more definate work done by then.
a added BROWSERS, which is a browsers compatibility listing. if you
  know of a browser on a particular platform that is not listed,
  please email jeff and let him know.
m fixed up the physician view... now works moderately well, and
  only displays the second address if it needs to.
m fixed freemed_config_value to actually return the value instead
  of the query #...
a adding rudimentary calendaring features... first a module called
  scheduler, then config options calshr/calehr, and vars in the
  global.var.inc for defaults. probably generating month calendars
  via GNU cal, and filtering. for those M$ NT buffs, you can find
  the source and recompile it.

19990613/19990614 --
* fixed problem in login denied... link was to $base_href instead
  of $base_url
* implemented API in insco module
* fixed null $_alternate value problem in freemed_bar_alternate_color
* implemented API in inscogroup module
* created _TEMPLATE_.php3 for developers... in mid creation as of
  this tarball..
* I'm not sure where or when I am, so I split this entry.

19990612 --
* I really have _got_ to stop doing this on the weekends.
* fixed stupid "localhost" bug in 19990611. made separate $db_host
  variable to fix problem with separate MySQL server.
* continuing current module GUI implementation.

19990611 --
* reworking the GUI and the API. how about some GNP or some GNU?
* added close button widget and banner to the box top
* many many many changes...

19990610 --
* more API functions, converting current modules to that standard.
* considering CVSing the project, due to popular demand.
* we have been asked for a general description of what is going on
  with us in terms of standards, dbs, etc... if someone would like
  to get back to the littlefish people with that, it would be much
  appreciated.

19990609 --
* skipped a day -- so what?
* implementing API functions in freemed-functions.inc
* added many API functions...
* added API documentation for all would-be module coders.
* fixed the problem with the freemed_open_db function.
* changed global.var.php3 to global.var.inc, with a symbolic
  link back for the time being, until i remember to change that
  in all of the modules.
* revised the credits to include Ryan Losh.
* moved configure point for rotating bar colors in view function
  to global.var.inc, and created function in API to deal with
  it.

19990607 --
* added freemed_get_userlevel function in functions module, to
  facilitate the use of user levels (returns user level, called
  with the user name)...
* the day that I remember to increment the version number...
* changed all phone #s to CHAR(10) from INT UNSIGNED, and changed
  upin to CHAR(15) [[ is that enough ?? ]]... thanks Ryan.
* updated admin module to new authentication scheme ... i'm not
  quite sure _how_ i missed this for so long.
* re-wrote head module to include support for automatically
  refreshing (say, upon an add)
* inscogroup module now refreshes on add, to bring the menu back
  up, and uses Header() instead of stupid META tag.
* admin menu is accessable from users with level 9 and root
  (the root accessability is for first time use, mostly, so
   that even if the user db does not exist, root can recreate
   everything)
* implemented broken form phone #s in physician module... for all
  those who know, substr uses indexes starting from "0", not 1.
  stupid language conventions. you go squish now.
* all mod and adds with phone and fax #s in physician module
  should work now.
* ssn # broken format support now added in physician module, and
  view contains ssn and #s reassembled.
* added physician status module (phystatus), and have been testing
  with different browsers. so far, Netscape 4.6, StarOffice 5.1
  Internal Browser, and KFM 1.1.1 have passed (although KFM needs
  a little tweaking with cookie policy).
* added delete_level in global.var module and changed to level
  check for deleting records in phystatus module... now should read
  if (freemed_get_userlevel($user)>$delete_level) ....
* added freemed_display_phystatus function in functions module,
  and finished relationalizing in add and modify functions, but
  not show yet.
* that's it for today. hope there are no errors in the tarball.

19990606 --
* didn't tar up yesterday...
* included Ryan Losh's descriptions of all of the dbs as of 19990602
  and what they do.
* haven't used user levels for real stuff. (this log entry was cut
  off in the 19990606 tarball, due to carelessness on my part) 

19990605 --
* implemented CPT modifier module (cptmod)... with add built into
  view, as per inscogroup module.
* seems to be error with MySQL adding users. will not re-read tables
  even when flushed, until mysqld is restarted. what is the problem?
* implemented user db for levels, etc.

19990603 --
* no work done today. only changed back to including opendb module
  instead of function... admin module wouldn't read stupid cookie.

19990602 --
* fixed problem with room module not loading, due to lack of
  freemed-functions.inc inclusion
* tweaked with cookie routines... not sure if fixed.
* same problem with lack of inclusion was in facility module... I
  must be getting slow in my old age.
* fixed lack of inscowebsite instance in add & mod routines in
  insco module
* added link from opening screen to this file, for those who are
  _terminally_ lazy...
* added debug notification on login screen, and will add to the
  boxfoot module...
* mostly cosmetic changes to main menu, with debug notification
* changed "Exit ..." to "logoff" for the terminally problematic.
* today was _way_ too busy. mostly bugfixes, but no major work was
  done. i think the next step is to add transactions. maybe? any
  comments on this one?

19990601 --
* this project has broken through the month of may...
* i think i accidentally mailed a 5 MB attachment to the list...
  if i did, please delete it.
* i've been very busy with the list, and have had trouble getting
  work done, but here goes...
* moved _actionbar module to freemed_display_actionbar($page_name)
  function
* began work (finally) on the insurance company module (insco), and
  will begin to implement an insurance company groups module (????)
  to track groups of insurance companies like BCBS...
* changed all physician.php3 references in physician module to
  $page_name references... (for greater ease of update...)
* converted _icdlist module to freemed_display_icdcodes, but have
  to find and update in the other modules.
* we've just had an offer to do a translation into french...
* i have added an img/ directory with the "powered by php3" graphic
  for the login screen, and hopefully a title graphic, if grendel
  drago ever gets off his _can_...
* fixed admin module to look nicer, and removed a few items from
  menu
* fixed freemed_open_db function to include $user and $pw params
* NOTE: remember to add passing _ref as parameter for actionbar,etc
* web server went down, possibly due to burnt modem. i'll look into
  that. in the meantime, i need to get a mirror, and quick...
* insurance company db implemented
* insurance company groups db implemented
* insurance company groups pretty much done, but insurance co
  view function not yet implemented.
* minor bug-fixes, added inscogroup module to the "main menu" (for
  the time being), and will consider adding tag from insco module
  to the inscogroups modules....???
* it's 6:15 and i'm bushed. time to tar this puppy.

19990529 --
* i wish i got paid for this... then it would make sense to work
  on the weekends...
* added _specialtydisplay module for physician module show action,
  and cleaned up the display. perhaps adding a modify button at the
  top and bottom??
* still haven't implemented hypenated SSN and phone #s, but that 
  will come soon enough.
* will remove the "title" field in the physican db, because the
  "specialty" db makes it obsolete.
* considering making id persistant with patients, so that it has
  the "memory" capacity, like Med Manager...? opinions?

19990528 --
* many many many changes...
* first, implemented cookie-based authentication, which means no
  more plain text passwords appearing...
* removed duplicate $_auth definition in redirect module
* changing all references to $user/$pw to $_auth, to simplify
  changing to cookie format
* changed instance of "ICD9" in patient module to PATIENT
* made the "you don't have access screen in the opendb module
  much cleaner, with a link to the login if they don't have
  access. we are officially on the way towards being secure,
  and with any luck, i'll add SSL support.
* converted tail.html -> tail module, and inserted the $coded_by
  variable in the php code
* added $_mail_handler variable for mail handling support
* inserted tail module in the end of help module
* fixed few misc brackets problems
* added __dummy field to initial login to hide password from 
  casual viewing.
* due to the cookie-based nature, it is recommended that users
  of this software turn _off_ their browsers' histories. that
  way, no record of your password will exist on your computer.
* starting with the facility module, the view section has taken
  the place of the default.
* added an abandon modification/abandon addition link at the
  bottom of the physician module add & modify routines...
* added an &nbsp; in the degrees column of the view section of
  the physician module, to fix a problem with Netscape viewing
  it.
* added a rudimentary show action (called view from the menu)
  which displays the entire record without modification...
  could serve as a jumping off point for other things.
  it currently has no relational or selected item capabilities,
  but it is only a prototype right now.
* refined the php tags in the redirect module, and added more
  redirect destinations.
* currently you have to change the $_cookie_expire in the
  global.var module to change the lifetime of the cookies.

19990527post --
* I have _really_ got to stop doing these post releases.
* facility db converted to new format... removing dependencies on
  old format, slowly.
* specialty db has most of dependencies removed... but needs
  $_ref=main.php3 taken out of main menu, done up with style of
  specialty module.
* grendel drago is a foofball for kicking me off of his console
  whilst i was trying to _code_, unlike other _LAZY_ slobs...

19990527 --
* I apologize to the faithful for the lack of tarballs available at
  the site... I told grendel drago to fix it, but knowing his holy
  bum-ness, i'll have to do it myself. in the meantime, I will mail
  out tarballs to anyone who wants them.
* removed duplicate $cur_date definitions from facility and room
  dbs.
* started work on specialty db, so that physician db could be
  made 100% complete (besides listings, of course...)
* changed date("Y-m-d") to $cur_date in facility and room modules,
  to make things easier on the eyes.
* changed "facility" to read "room" in room module, notification of
  lack of returns on query.
* created _specialtylist internal module to deal with specialty
  listings in physician db...
* physician db now has hooks for specialty db, but there is a
  problem -- phone and fax seem to give errors, changing them to
  CHAR(10)s, and adding formatting soon (splitting and combining
  fields : 1234567890 =>> ( 123 ) 456 - 7890 =>> 1234567890 ) 
  also pt phone & fax now 10 digit, and SSNs 9 digits...
* too many changes in specialty db to mention. it now has the new
  menubar format, which i will expand to fit all of our needs, soon,
  but in the meantime, i'll modify the other dbs to have the same
  neato format for viewing, instead of what is there now... maybe
  in addition to searching...?
* try the new specialty view from the main menu
* specialty and room modules have been converted to new format, but
  the question remains whether they are completely converted... some
  of the menus, such as the obsolete "select" action will be deleted
  if the format proves to be workable. bug reports, please.
* due to db modifications, reinitialize your database, then fill out
  the specialty, physician, room, and facility databases.... if you
  want to see new features. broken field phone #s will be available
  soon, maybe tomorrow.

19990526 --
* after a hard night of post fixes, here are some more...
* fixed bug in code for facility module, where psrnote was confused
  with psrname... probably in my horrible haste.
* after a _long_ meeting with the doc, we've decided on a few more
  ways things should be... but not neccesarily how to implement them.
* completed the database structure for procedures in the admin
  module... which worked on the first try, thanks to no stupid
  UNSIGNED INTs...
* added a cur_date_hash variable in the global variables, to allow
  for generated numbers from the date, with something else tacked on
  after...
* fixed procedure db add to be up to snuff, including the actual
  SQL command... I hope that I didn't misspell anything.
* since its moderately obvious that i modified the physician module
  to become the procedure module, the procedure module has just been
  cleaned of most phy and physician references. add works, but mod
  del and search have not been coded yet. i've had a busy day at my
  day job.
* most likely adding another function to the modules... (late, I know,
  but better late than never) ... a view function, with buttons or
  links at the top to perform actions (like adding dependants, creating
  vouchers, etc...) which would become the default thing, as opposed
  to the clunky functions we have implemented now. will have a _ref
  parameter issued to it, so that you can return to whatever you were
  doing before...

19990525post --
* so, I officially have no life. this is after the official release,
  and I just found a major bug in the _icdlist, _doclist and
  _facilitylist subroutines, where it would display SELECTED for all
  items due to a lack of checking against the given parameter. It
  is all fixed, but after the daily release. oops.
* forgot to modify a few items in the room module. just took care of
  it, so it should work better.
* the check boxes for booking enabled and surgery don't work yet,
  due to an unforseen problem. they will be moved to a pulldown
  menu as soon as I remember.
* TO ALL BRAVE SOULS TRYING THIS: remember that if you don't
  reinitialize the database, a new tarball may not work, since db
  structures and such will change on a daily basis. be forewarned.

19990525 --
* got tired of waiting for minor databases, began to code facility
  and room databases
* modified admin to be "good" PHP3 code, and release $result after
  every database add in reinit, then decided against it.
* finished prototype for facility database, and heard from the 
  first "freemed" fan. if anyone else is using this, please give
  me a hollar... i'd like to know if we're going in the right
  direction.
* adding rudimentary directions...
* note for C programmers... SQL doesn't like UNSIGNED INT, only
  INT UNSIGNED. i feel dumb after 1/2 hour of bug-looking-for.
* facility module seems to work, but needs tidying up. will do later,
  am in the zone.
* fixed facility db lack of date stamp, coded _facilitylist.php3
  internal module for facility listings in room module.
* _just_ added the room module, expect problems in formatting, etc...
  originally was part of facility module, but split to accomidate
  in-house booking. relational database is 100% operational in this
  area.

19990524 --
* i have _got_ to remember to update the version number in the
  global.var module...
* implemented graphics choice in config module, but not quite sure
  where to read in the variable...
* i am suspending the procedure module until the good doctor can
  decide whether these are for procedure prototypes or instances. 

19990523 --
* the littlefish project (www.littlefish.au?) contacted me about the
  prospect of collaborating. cool.
* found the stupid bug... ever forget a </SELECT> tag on something?
  it was the last ICD9/10 code in procedure module.
* yesterday was broken, but today will be a tarball, only minor
  weekend changes.
* changed ICD9 to ICD to be more generic in icd9 module... but..
  the module name... d'oh!
* took out the second "me" in the bottom of the procedure module...
  oh, but i like the recognition, fame... well, not fame, but...

19990522 --
* may not have a release today (saturday), but must note that the name
  freemed as pertaining to the name of the program we are coding... is
  or has been taken already by some Wintel Med-Management piece of
  software. will most likely remain "the freemed project", but will
  call the software freeMOSS (free Medical Office System Software),
  continuing to issue it under the GPL. for a copy of the freemed (TM)
  software (for the terminally wintel based), go to the SimTel archive.
* put relational icd9 bit into procedure module for all four. seems to
  crash the kfm i am using from home... don't know why -- probably a
  kfm bug fixed in 1.1.1
* main module now has link to procedure module for my ease of coding.
* might have multiple selectable menu layouts.... same ideas as help
  files? will have config switch in config db.

19990521 --
* removed link status adding a dependant if the patient is already a
  dependant. (now just have to remember to build in the routine to
  pull address info, etc from the guarantor, or at least default to
  that information)
* created configuration database, where we can store information, such
  as ICD9 or ICD10 (preference)...
* configuration menu active from admin menu... ICD9/10 selection needs
  to be made active in the DBs where it is needed.
* removed obnoxious ?> bug in icd9.php3 where it would display "area
  ?>"...
* added a few more redirect codes in redirect.php3
* removed date of entry in icd9.php3 as a field... and set it to
  display only.
* fixed spelling bug in icd9.php3 data extraction (icddng -> icdng) 
* multiple file help system ready, but not implemented (to implement,
  set $_hf in global.var.php3 to be 1)... currently using case
  statement.
* changed head.html -> head.php3 for easier switches of info...
* moved the old procedure.php3 to procedure_old.php3, and began to
  convert it into a working DB, with ICD9/10 support.
* created _icdlist.php3 to display a list of ICD9/10 codes (depending
  on configuration) in a drop-down SELECT/OPTION box, the same way
  as _doclist.php3 does now.
* fixed bug where deleting a physician returned "DELETING USER"... is
  this in any module other than physician.php3?
* moved the global.var.php3 include to before the head.php3 to make
  sure that global variables were set first.
* updated the title and banner to show a little more about the
  package... but the database will remain with the name "package"
  until it reaches bare-bones usability in a medical environment.
* put in exit command from main menu and implemented base_url from
  global.vars
* NOTE TO SELF: remove other references to $cur_date, since it is now
  in global.vars
* cutting out early today. will work on weekend.

19990520 --
* added ptdep (guarantor link) to patient.php3. 19990519 is a little
  broken -- accidentally built tarball in /var/package.
* found a way to do guarantors... add link to patient find that
  creates dependants (and a link to separate a dependant, if their
  ptdep != 0)
* finished add and modify routines for patient db, but somehow
  broke the select... the search function works fine. must bring
  someone somewhere. fix later.
* fixed link back to physician menu at bottom of add physician scn.
* fixed bug in patient select screen (ORDER instead of ORDER BY)
  that prevented listing of patients.
* need to create the speciality db, as well as some other minor dbs
* removed ailment menu option, since that hasn't been implemented
  yet.
* prettied up the "MAIN MENU" by inserting nbsp...
* still awaiting more db structures from the doc.
* fixed bug in update/modify where employed status was forgotton.
* added "add dependant" option to patient search results... can
  detach via pulldown menu in modify patient.
* must make a reattach guarantor function, but not sure how yet. will
  figure out in next few days.

19990519 --
* added BGCOLOR=#ffffff to head.html to fix obnoxious netscape
  problem of always using the wrong background color.
* determined that an "end of day" set of commands will reindex and
  compact the database, and also update the counts and totals in the
  various databases. until the basic dbs are written, it won't be
  possible to implement that (or at least, highly improbably)
* 19990518 came out as 19990518-1, due to my impression that I was
  doing two snapshots today. will change filename if it ever is
  important to do so.
* ICD9/10 database complete under icd9.php3 (no interdependencies
  yet)... daily end-of-day updating not implemented in icd9.php3,
  perhaps in admin.php3
* will add tags for PHP3 to detect browser, and enable javascript
  add and subtract buttons, etc, if the browser supports it. this
  much later.
* implemented _doclist.php3 module to simplify SELECT/OPTION
  clauses across modules. doctors are listed in a list box, and
  a default one is selectable via $param passed var. could have
  done this as a function, but this was way too easy.
* in _doclist.php3 (1st actual relational module), added order, so
  that SELECT/OPTION pulldown would be in alpha order
* patient.php3 is still horribly broken, since I am still convert-
  ing it from the old icd9.php3 document. I finally counted right
  and got the add function to work. god, these changelog entries
  had better _not_ be this long every day. fix patient.php3
  tomorrow. i sleep now.

19990518 --
* completed add, modify and delete routines for physicians.
* the physician module is complete, and is ready to be "cloned" for
  other database modules, with the exception of interdatabase
  relationships, which will be coded as we go.
* all doubts about MySQL being a stable db went up in smoke as I
  found that the bug was actually the inability of kedit to show
  me the difference between two kinds of quotes. that'll be the
  last time _I_ stray from good ol' VI. (thankfully, the CHANGELOG
  is done in VI, for increased doughy goodness) -jeff b
* some links back to "Administration Menu", at least in the
  physician package, are being moved to point to the main menu. If
  there are submenus, and godforbid, a structure, they'll be moved
  to there.
* mental note - remember to update hyperlink menu (/whatever
  jumps to certain modules....)
* numbering version scheme will be implemented at about the time
  that the package is ready for RPM packaging (full database
  implementation for usable functionality)
* remember to change the name from "package" to "freemed" as soon
  as a few more dbs are available for usage.
* remember to make script for install to create default users
  (root & webuser) with default pws, so as not to put anyone off.
  (also, a grant table scheme, modified by a user-controlled
  user table is looking better and better)

19990514 --
* began to realise that the changelog should be updated.
* added entire physician structure to database, as well as add and
  delete, no modify working yet. 
* add physician doesn't work unless I manually plunk it in... is
  mySQL a bad platform choice?
* for user update/delete, remember to combine, as in physician.php3 

19990510 --
* began changelog.
* already have implemented user addition and deletion features, but no
  permissions (user levels) or any such refinements.
* quick-jump (/whatever) feature works, with redirector PHP3 script
* still waiting on prototypes and menu layouts from dr_gnu... in this
  arena implementation is still stalled, although the user add and del
  routines demonstrate most or all of the characteristics of the
  working database.
* have not implemented flush-tables after delete user, only add. will
  fix.
* this only is a framework, and cannot be used for anything remotely
  medical in nature, but... as soon as the layouts arrive, this will
  kick into high gear.

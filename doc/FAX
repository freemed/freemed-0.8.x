Fax Setup Documentation

1) Create a user account for XML-RPC transport. This user should have access
	to the entire system, and should be given database, delete and
	administrative access.

2) Modify data/config/xmlrpc.ini to reflect your server configuration.

3) Install a working copy of hylafax. For Debian users, this involves
	issuing the "apt-get install hylafax-server" command.

4) Install the crontab fragment in scripts/fax_import into /etc/cron.d/ 
	(This location is correct for Debian users; your installation
	directories may vary.) This action should have been performed by
	your packager.

5) Make sure that img/store is owned by your web user (www-data under
	Debian), and that they have write permissions to this directory.
	This is also necessary for any other operations that involve
	scanned documents. The same applies for data/fax/unread and
	data/fax/unfiled.

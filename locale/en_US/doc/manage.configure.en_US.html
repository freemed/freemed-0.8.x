Configuring FreeMED's EMR is very simple; using the tabbed notebook,
select the options that you would prefer your EMR to be displayed with.
Each user can specify the format that they would like to see EMRs in,
which can help facilitate specialized EMR modules for specific
professions inside a larger installation (for example, pediatricians
could have pediatric-specific modules which no one else would have to
see, and radiologists could have radiology-specific modules that only
they could see).

<UL><U>General Configuration</U>

	<LI><I>Automatic Refresh Time</I> - This allows the record
	display to be automatically reloaded after a certain period
	of time, providing up-to-date information. By default FreeMED
	is set not to refresh.

	<LI><I>Columns in Display</I> - Specifies the number of boxes
	across that should be displayed in the master EMR display.
	This may not have an effect in all themes.

	<LI><I>Number of Summary Items</I> - Sets the maximum number
	of items to be displayed in each EMR panel. This should be set
	at a reasonable number, like 2 or 5.

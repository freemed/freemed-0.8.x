Welcome to FreeMED, the world's premiere web-based
open-source practice management and electronic medical
record software!

<P>

If you need explaination of any of FreeMED's concepts,
go to the %%Concept list,concept%%.

<P>

The main menu is the center of FreeMED's navigation. From
here, you can use access any part of the FreeMED software.

	<LI>%%Administration Menu,admin%% - If you
	have administrator access to FreeMED, you'll see this
	menu. It allows you to add and remove users, modify
	FreeMED's global configuration, and perform actions
	involving the database. If this is your first time running
	FreeMED as an administrator, you have to go to this
	menu and initialize the database, or else FreeMED
	will be unable to function properly.

	<LI><I>Billing Functions</I> - The entire billing interface of
	FreeMED is available via this menu. Some functions
	reqiure a patient to already be selected before using these
	functions.

	<LI><I>Call In</I> - Call-ins are available for potential
	patients who call for an appointment, but have a possibility
	of not showing up. This is useful if you don't want to fill up
	your patient database with people who you might not see in 
	the office.

	<LI><I>Database Functions</I> - If you can see this menu, you
	have access to some of FreeMED's lower-level functions.
	With this menu, you can modify the internal workings,
	catalogs, and listings that make FreeMED work.

	<LI>%%Patient Functions,patient%% - This is the EMR, and all
	patient EMR functions are available via this menu. Some
	skins have a patient history on the left hand bar which
	allow you to simply select a recently viewed patient to
	view without having to reselect them.

	<LI><I>Reports</I> - This controls the report modules. More
	reports can be added by contacting your system administrator,
	or you can use Query Maker or the Custom Records portion
	of FreeMED.

	<LI><I>Calendar</I> - These are the calendar bits.

	<LI><I>Logout of FreeMED</I> - This will log you out of
	FreeMED. Please remember to log out if you will be
	away from your computer for an extended period of time.

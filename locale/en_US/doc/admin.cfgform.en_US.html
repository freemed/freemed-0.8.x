These are the user-configurable parameters for FreeMED. This menu
is accessed via the %%Administration Menu,admin%%.

<UL>

	<LI><I>ICD Code Type</I> - Legacy select switch to determine
	whether you are using the ICD9 or ICD10 diagnosis codes.

	<LI><I>Graphics Enhanced</I> - Determines if graphical
	enhancements should be used in the FreeMED interface.
	This does not have an effect in all themes.

	<LI><I>Scheduling Start/End Time</I> - Sets when the scheduler
	should begin and end allowing appointments to be booked.

	<LI><I>Calendar Overbooking</I> - This can allow the same
	location to have more than one appointment booked for it,
	which some practices need. Normally you would leave this as
	"disabled" to not allow this.

	<LI><I>Date/Phone Format</I> - Sets the entry format for dates
	and telephone numbers throughout FreeMED. Set this to
	your country's preferred date and phone number format.

	<LI><I>Form Folding</I> - Most forms in FreeMED by default are
	several pages, which can be accessed by notebook-like tabs at
	the top of the form. If you would rather have long forms that
	you can scroll through, disable form folding.

This is the <I>Administration Menu</I> of FreeMED. It can be
reached either through the <I>Main Menu</I> or via the menu bar on
the left side of the screen using the default theme.

<P>

<UL>

	<LI><I>Import/Export Databases</I> - This gives you the ability to
	import and export FreeMED's low-level databases to CSV type
	files, which can be read by most programs. This is good for
	exchanging data with other programs that cannot use FreeMED's
	XML-RPC capabilities.

	<LI><I>Module Information</I> - Provides a list of the installed
	loadable modules on the system and basic information about them.

	<LI><I>Reinitialize Database</I> - This is the first step that you
	should take when creating a new installation of FreeMED. It
	wipes all of the tables in the database and has the option to reload
	the stock data tables that come with FreeMED. This should
	<U>never</U> be used on a running system, or else complete loss of
	data will occur.

	<LI>%%Update Config,admin,cfgform%% - Set the parameters
	that FreeMED uses to define various portions of its behavior.

	<LI><I>User Maintenance</I> - Add and remove users from the system.
	Please note that you <U>cannot</U> remove the root user from the
	system.

</UL>

Some of the functions in this menu require superuser access. The information
for your "superuser" account (by default called "root") should never be given
out, and should be guarded closely, as it has an incredible amount of power
to modify the system.

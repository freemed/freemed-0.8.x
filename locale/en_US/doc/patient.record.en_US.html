The core EMR of FreeMED is located in the "patient" table of the database,
and is split into several logical sections, which are represented as "tabs"
when adding or modifying a patient record. The EMR is expandable as "modules"
which, though still part of the EMR, are stored in different tables.

<UL>EMR Sections

	<LI><I>Primary Information</I> - Name, address and date of birth.

	<LI><I>Contact</I> - Phone numbers, email address, fax number.

	<LI><I>Personal</I> - Gender, marital status, employment status,

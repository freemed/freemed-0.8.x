# This is the auto-import bash script, which loops through all entries in
# the Hylafax receive queue and forces them to be imported into FreeMED,
# first by being OCR'd and converted to DJVU, then by being transported
# via XML-RPC (using the XMLRPC::Lite / SOAP::Lite toolkit) into FreeMED.

# Check lsof to see if hylafax is still using the file first, otherwise
# faxes will be cut off.
